# ConsoleStarPatterns

**ConsoleStarPatterns** is a collection of C++ programs that generate visually appealing star and character-based patterns in the console. These programs are ideal for beginners learning about loops, console output, and basic user interaction in C++.

## Features

- Multiple pattern designs using stars (`*`) or any character of your choice
- User input support for customizing the pattern character
- Well-structured code, easy to modify for new patterns

| File Name      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Holo_Star.cpp  | Prints a fixed, decorative star pattern in the console.                     |
| star.cpp       | Prompts the user for a character and prints a large, customizable pattern.  |

## Usage

1. **Compile the desired file using a C++ compiler:**

    ```
    g++ Holo_Star.cpp -o holo_star
    g++ star.cpp -o star_pattern
    ```

2. **Run the executable:**

    ```
    ./holo_star
    ./star_pattern
    ```

    - For `star.cpp`, you will be prompted to enter a character; the pattern will be drawn using your input.
